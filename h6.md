# Tor: The Second-Generation Onion Router
## Chapter 3: Design goals and assumptions
* Frustrate attackers from linking communication partners, multiple communications to and from a single user.
* Deployability: must be deployable in real world, inexpensive to run, requiring reasonable bandwidth, low burden on operators, mustn’t be expensive or difficult to implement. No anonymous running of the software.
* Usability: hard to use system has few users which itself is a security requirement. Shouldn’t require modification of common applications, nor introduce prohibitive delays, as few configuraitons as possible.Should be implementable across all OS.
* Flexibility: Protocol must be flexible for future research
* Simple design: protocol design and security parameters must be well understood. Aim is to deploy a simple & stable system to protecting anonymity.

# De-Anonymisation Attacks on Tor: A Survey
* Anonymity networks becoming increasingly common as people seek to safeguard privacy online.
* Tor is the most common anonymity network for users and hidden services.
* Tor is being misused for illegal activities e.g. illegal sites, selling drugs, hosting CC servers, distributing censored content etc
* Governements and law enforcement interested in attacks to de-anonymize the Tor networks.
* The paper surveys attacks to de-anonymize Tor users and hidden services.
* Early anonymity networks (Mix-Net, Babel, Mixminion) suffered high latency issues and succeeded by low latency systems such as The Onion Router project known as Tor.
* Pro-anonymity users strengthen anonymity by improving security and fixing known bugs.
* Tor, l2p and Freenet use the concept of onion routing.
* Tor is an overlay network based on TCP building circuit from the user to destination server.
## Key components and their features:
* Onion Proxy (OP):  Tor client. Smal piece of software on users devices that communicates with directory servers (DS), establishes connection to Tor network, connections from users applications.
* Directory servers (DS): small set of known servers. Actively keep status of complete network (relays, bandwidth availability, exit policies). OP download this infor from DS.
* Entry Node/Guard: entry point for Onion Proxy to Tor network. Knows the IP address of the Tor clients. Adversary Entry Node can pose as a genuine node and get traffic from Tor Clients. 
* Exit Node: Final node of the Tor network. Knows IP address of the destionation server. Encryption also ends here, unless client users end to end ecnryption such as TLS. Adversary Exit node can observe traffic to destination.
* Hidden services/Onion services: Tor provides anonymity to users but doesn’t hide website being accessed. Entity with access to traffic at exit node can see website address between exit node and destination server. To eliminate this, services is hosted inside Tor network or external node with top level domain name of .onion. HS advertised these .onion addresses over the public internet. Attracts criminal and unethical conduct.
* Introduction Points: random nodes selected by hidden services to register its services with Tor network.
* Rendezvous Points (RPs):randon Tor node Tor client selects to initiate connection with introduction points advertised by  directory servers.
* Bridges: Normal Tor relays not listed publicly in Tor directory, they replace guard nodes in the circuit.
* a Tor client must establish a circuit through the Tor network.
* Attacks on Tor include: Network distruption, censorship, generic and de-anonymization attacks.
* De-anonymization attacks can be targeted to side channel, entry & exit routers, OP/OR/server and hybrid.

# PhishSticks - The Ethical Hackers tool for BadUSB
* Phishstick is simulated bad USB dropper. 
* Can be disguised as USB devices with malicious payload e.g. keylogger
* Use injected keystrokes, opens up windows run, types a onlinner to fetch payload through windows powershell. Records any keystrokes made
* Attack appears very briefly on screen and is easy to miss.
* Records any keystrokes made by the user, log data is stored in the Temp folder of the victim then sent to the attacked. Data is sent via HTTP POST then deleted from victims machine.
