# Computer Forensics
* Cyberattacks on computing machines leave certain artifacts on target devices. 
* These artifacts when processed and analysed intelligently can reveal the identity and behaviour of the cyber criminals.
* Forensic agencies and law enforcements utilize digital forensic toolkits to formulate investigations and reports. These toolkits are both commercial and open source.
* Computer forensic information can be extracted from applications such as software, databases, the web and emails. In addition, these can be extracted from hardware devices such as memory cards, smart cards, dongles, cameras, biometric scanners, routers, pages, printers, answering machines, GPS systems etc.
# The process flow of digital forensic 
* The process and flow of a digital forensic investigation is as shown below. Identifying compromised devices, collection of data, examination of the data and devices, assessment and investigation and creating and compiling the report.

Identification -> Collection -> Examination -> Assessment/Investigation -> Report

The process of investigation begins when the incident is reported, and a crime is detected to have been committed. 

# Computer forensic domains 
The figure below shows the different  computer forensic domains.

# Operating System Forensics:
* The process of extracting important and useful information from the operating system of the computer or mobile device.
## Promising tools in this domain: 
* Belkasoft Evidence Center and OS Forensic. This tools allows the identification of suspicious files and activities with hash matching, drive signature comparisons, emails, memory, and binary data.
# File System Forensics:
* The analysis of the file system which depends on data that is inside of a partition or disk. It involves processing the data to extract the contents of a file or even recovering contents of a deleted file.
## Promising tools in this domain: 
* Belkasoft Evidence Center and FTK.
# Live Memory Forensics:
* RAM is the intermediate memory between the processor and the storage. Processing and analysing this can reveal hidden processes, malware and toolkits.
## Promising tools in this domain:
* Volatility tool  with multi-OS support, open licensing and CLI support.
# Web Forensics:
* Analysis and processing activities that have performed on a web browser. This information includes web storage record sessions, searches, history. The OS and web browser has a means of keeping such records.
## Promising tools in this domain:
* Encase and redline with maximum multi-browser support.
# Email Forensics:
* This involves collecting evidence from emails. The services could be from webmail or local mailbox.
## Promising tools in this domain:
* Belkasoft Evidence Center supports offline and online email analysis and support multiple mailboxes.
# Network Forensics:
* This analyses focuses on monitoring the network traffic and investigating the attack sources.
## Promising tools in this domain:
* Network Miner, LogRythm, PLIXER, NIKSUN, Nmap and XPLiCO. All are open source except PLIXER.
# Multimedia Forensics:
* Users today enjoy smartphones, high bandwidth internet connections, rich media and affordable storage. Image forensic identifying the imaging device that captured the images, detecting traces of forgeries.
## Promising tools in this domain: 
* IntaForensics and Cognitech.
# Others:
* Other forensic domains include cloud forensics that are committed on cloud platforms, database forensics investigate data storage and privacy related crimes.

# Classification of computer forensic tools
* The tools can be classigied based on the domains the tool is used to investigate, the tool licenses, tool interaction, platform supported by the tool, and the supported image file formats. The figure below shows the taxonomy of the computer forensic investigation tools.

# Challenges in Digital forensic
* The challenges in digital forensic are technological challenges, legal challenges, and resource challenges. The figure below lists the unique set of challenges in each of these three areas.
